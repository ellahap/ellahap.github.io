                <p class = "project-title">Hammock Finder Website</p>
                <p class = "date">Summer 2024</p>
                <p class = "descr">I am currently working on this site, based on an idea I got from a 
                    <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/UIUC/comments/on0yjn/map_for_collective_hammock_spots_on_campus/">reddit post</a>.  
                        My primary motivation for finishing the site is actually reply to the thread with the finished site, and hopefully have some people try it out!  
                            I originally found that reddit post because I was looking for hammock spots on campus, and so I would definitely be one to use the finder myself.<br><br>
                                My current gameplan is to source tree location data from the 
                                    <a href="https://illinoisedu.treekeepersoftware.com/index.cfm?deviceWidth=1512">UIUC tree database</a>, filtering for trees that have a 
                                        DBH (diameter at breast height) >6 inches, and filtering out stunmps.  Then, using JS find and save the coordinates of the trees that 
                                            are 10-20 feet apart, and load the coordinates into the map.  Finally, display the map coordinates, with directions to get there.  As an
                                                extension to add more features, I'd look into automatically updating the website with data every few days, adding backend to
                                                    allow users to rate, review, add, tag, and favorite hammock spots, and factor in sun angles to determine if spots are 
                                                        shady or not.  Definitely a work in progress that can go many different directions.

                <p class = "date">2019</p>
                <div class="descr-container">
                    <p class = "descr">I made this project in 8th grade, but I think it's a cool first computer project!
                        It's an automatic cello tuner, which hijacked an electronic tuner's LED output power, rewiring it
                            to inform my arduino.  The electronic tuner would light up one LED if the note was sharp, and
                                the other if it was flat, so by rewiring the current my program knew which way to turn the
                                    cello pegs.  These pegs were connected to a gear system I made out of LEGOs, powered by
                                        a LEGO motor.  The program was written in ardiuno's unique language in their IDE, and
                                            was one of the first programs I ever wrote!  The final product is a cello that tunes
                                                itelf as you play a note.
